# 🚀 30-Day SQL & Python Blog Series for Data Analysts  
### *A journey into intermediate and advanced data analysis concepts with real-world interview scenarios*

---

## 👋 Welcome!

Are you a data analyst looking to deepen your practical SQL and Python skills? This **30-day blog series** is designed specifically for **intermediate to advanced-level** practitioners who want to tackle real-world, scenario-based problems, often seen in interviews or on the job.

---

## 📌 What’s the Plan?

We’ll split the 30 days into **two focused tracks**:

### 🔹 Week 1–2 (Days 1–14): SQL using PostgreSQL
Master intermediate to advanced SQL using PostgreSQL. We’ll cover window functions, partitioning, analytical rankings, lag/lead, running totals, time-based queries, CTEs, and more.

### 🔹 Week 3–4 (Days 15–30): Python for Data Analysis
Move into advanced Python for data analysis using `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib/seaborn`. You’ll work on EDA, group operations, joins, filtering tricks, time series, and real-world data wrangling tasks.

## 🔄 Learning Pattern

Every week follows a structure:

| Day     | Focus                                      |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| Day 1–6  | Deep dive into new concepts                 |
| Day 7    | Scenario-based project combining Days 1–6   |
| Repeat!  |                                             |

This way, you’ll retain what you learn and **simulate real-world interview problems** every week.
